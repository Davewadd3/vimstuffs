Yes, I know this has a bunch of repositories also in it which are included.
The company that I work at enforces a firewall that will block any attempts to init submodules etc
I can mirror repositories at will though
So rather than doing a bunch of work to mirror all the bundles and plugins I want
I'm including them all here, seeing as I already have this all set up on my personal computer. 
Also means when I get new stuff or update anything I can just push and pull to get an up to date setup there too :)
